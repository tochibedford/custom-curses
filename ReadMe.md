# Custom CURSES

## Beautiful Cursors

![ts](https://badgen.net/badge/Built%20With/TypeScript/blue)

A simple Library to add custom cursors to your Webpage in Javascript.
It utilizes the HTMLCanvasElement .

Preview:

```javascript
import { Cursor, Pointer, initializeCanvas } from "custom-curses";
let objects = [];
const pointer1 = new Pointer(
  { pointerShape: ["string", "üëÜ"], size: 100, drag: 0.1, xOffset: 15 },
  objects
);
const pointer2 = new Pointer(
  {
    pointerShape: ["string", "üò≤"],
    size: 20,
    drag: 0.9,
    xOffset: 100,
    yOffset: 50,
  },
  objects
);
const pointer3 = new Pointer(
  {
    pointerShape: ["string", "‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§"],
    size: 20,
    drag: 0.97,
    xOffset: 100,
    yOffset: 50,
  },
  objects
);
const cursor1 = new Cursor({
  pointers: [pointer1, pointer2, pointer3],
  drag: 0 /*where 1 is max*/,
  hideMouse: true,
});
let canvasObject = initializeCanvas(cursor1, objects);
```

## React

You only need to wrap the `initializeCanvas` function in a `useEffect` hook

More example usages in `./examples/`

## Features

- It accepts Emojis, and any string you can use in the canvas normally and the rotation of said characters.
- It also supports normal animated canvas objects but it isn't fully implemented yet.
- You can adjust the drag on each individual pointer and for the cursor as a whole.
- You can adjust the X and Y offset for each pointer individually and for the cursor as a whole.

- The library now works with React (just wrap it in a useEffect at the top level component)

## The way it works

- Several Pointer objects can be bound to a cursor Object. You can theoretically pass in an infinite number of Pointers to the cursor.
- The cursor object is then drawn to the canvas. For each animation loop it waits for all canvas objects to draw and update before clearing the canvas.
- A canvas object is instantiated and bound to the Cursor Object.
- The canvas element is only allowed to have 1 Cursor Object, not sure why anyone would want other wise.

## Installation

Using npm:
`npm install custom-curses`

Provision will be made for a cdn link
